                I learned a whole lot about HTML and CSS in this assignment!
                This little project is the first real experience I have with HTML and CSS.
                The tools of web development are a lot less intimidating to me than they felt to me before starting this course.
                I like the markup language and I think so far it has been pretty intuitive to me.
                I wouldn’t say that I have encountered any significant challenges in making this webpage,
                just about any place I got stuck I was able to resolve pretty quickly by playing around with values and doing a bit of googling.
                Though to be fair, I am not doing anything especially complicated.
                I am most proud of being able to separate my main page into two halves,
                I think it looks much nicer than my selfie being below the text.
                By far the most useful resource in constructing this webpage would be the lectures I have so far attended on web development.
                I’ve also found a lot of very helpful information on the Ed Discussion forums.
