                I learned a whole lot about HTML and CSS in this assignment!
                This little project is the first real experience I have with HTML and CSS.
                The tools of web development are a lot less intimidating to me than they felt to me before starting this course.
                I like the markup language and I think so far it has been pretty intuitive to me.
                I wouldn’t say that I have encountered any significant challenges in making this webpage,
                just about any place I got stuck I was able to resolve pretty quickly by playing around with values and doing a bit of googling.
                Though to be fair, I am not doing anything especially complicated.
                I am most proud of being able to separate my main page into two halves,
                I think it looks much nicer than my selfie being below the text.
                By far the most useful resource in constructing this webpage would be the lectures I have so far attended on web development.
                I’ve also found a lot of very helpful information on the Ed Discussion forums.

                I am quite proud of what I have been able to accomplish with this assignment.
                The screenshots of what we needed to transform the webpage into seems daunting at first,
                but as I chipped away at the various requirements I could quickly see it coming together.
                This assignment was much more challenging than the first,
                but I do not believe that the pace of the class is getting away from me.
                I think, in fact, that the pace is just about right to really dive into web development.
                We have explored a lot more of web development a lot sooner than I expected we would.
                The most challenging part of this second assignment was attempting to right-justify the text on each of the posts.
                They are still center aligned, so I was never able to solve this issue.
                I think it has something to do with the fact that the three elements of text under each post are concatenated to the previous by a 'span' tag.
                This causes the elements to behave in ways that I do not understand.

                I found this assignment to be quite a bit easier than I anticipated it would be.
                I think this is because I am so familiar with other programming languages including Python.
                Python is of course a weakly-typed and interpreted language, and the two languages feel similar to me.
                I was able to implement the extra credit option of adding cities to the dropdown menu.
                I think this is actually the easier thing to do because I did not need to check that the user entered a valid city.
