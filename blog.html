                I learned a whole lot about HTML and CSS in this assignment!
                This little project is the first real experience I have with HTML and CSS.
                The tools of web development are a lot less intimidating to me than they felt to me before starting this course.
                I like the markup language and I think so far it has been pretty intuitive to me.
                I wouldn’t say that I have encountered any significant challenges in making this webpage,
                just about any place I got stuck I was able to resolve pretty quickly by playing around with values and doing a bit of googling.
                Though to be fair, I am not doing anything especially complicated.
                I am most proud of being able to separate my main page into two halves,
                I think it looks much nicer than my selfie being below the text.
                By far the most useful resource in constructing this webpage would be the lectures I have so far attended on web development.
                I’ve also found a lot of very helpful information on the Ed Discussion forums.

                I am quite proud of what I have been able to accomplish with this assignment.
                The screenshots of what we needed to transform the webpage into seems daunting at first,
                but as I chipped away at the various requirements I could quickly see it coming together.
                This assignment was much more challenging than the first,
                but I do not believe that the pace of the class is getting away from me.
                I think, in fact, that the pace is just about right to really dive into web development.
                We have explored a lot more of web development a lot sooner than I expected we would.
                The most challenging part of this second assignment was attempting to right-justify the text on each of the posts.
                They are still center aligned, so I was never able to solve this issue.
                I think it has something to do with the fact that the three elements of text under each post are concatenated to the previous by a 'span' tag.
                This causes the elements to behave in ways that I do not understand.

                I found this assignment to be quite a bit easier than I anticipated it would be.
                I think this is because I am so familiar with other programming languages including Python.
                Python is of course a weakly-typed and interpreted language, and the two languages feel similar to me.
                I was able to implement the extra credit option of adding cities to the dropdown menu.
                I think this is actually the easier thing to do because I did not need to check that the user entered a valid city.

                This assignment was one of the more difficult ones, but ironically I was able to complete it in the least amount of time.
                It was able to finally click for me when I conceived of the server as being essentially a recursive function.
                I took way too long trying to make a request -> response function for each of the files individually, which was a bad idea.
                It was easier than I anticipated to implement the dynamic posts part of the project, which was nice.
                I like this assignment and I feel like I have learned a lot from it.
                I find it charming how we’ve been updating the same Benny’s list website over and over to become progressively more complicated with each assignment.

                This assignment was by far the most difficult one for me, and the one I have spent the most amount of time on.
                I was generously offered an extension to the deadline for this assignment because I couldn't get it working by the original deadline.
                As of now, I’ve worked through the issues I had been having with handlebars and now I am very happy with how the assignment has turned out.
                I struggled for a very long time to get handlebars and express-handlebars working in my project.
                I was eventually able to get it right by rewatching a couple lectures more than once. 
                Once I was able to get handlebars working the way I expected it to, I was able to make a lot of progress on the assignment.
                I was at first very intimidated by the fact that we would be marked down for duplicate HTML code in our handlebars templates,
                but by the end of the assignment I had a strong enough understanding to tackle that.  As far as I am aware,
                there is no duplicate HTML code in any of the handlebars files and I have been able to meet every requirement for the assignment.
                I certainly was able to beat my own expectations for this assignment by the time I finished it, which is very nice.
