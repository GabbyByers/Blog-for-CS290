            I am not coming into this class with any prior web development skills.
            I have once before made an unenthusiastic attempt to break into the world of HTML and CSS prior to this class,
            but this didn't really go anywhere. Iâ€™m glad to be here in this course to give it a fresh effort.
            So far the things I am learning in this course have made web development a lot more exciting to me!

            In this class I hope to acquire a solid baseline of skill for web development.
            I would love to create a personal webpage for myself to show off the coding projects I work on.
            Perhaps also to create a resume webpage for myself more generally.
            Maybe even something that I could use to host or distribute the projects I create.

            I have signed up for the Ed Discussion forum and even though I haven't made any posts there yet,
            the conversations of others there have already helped me out a lot!

            I love computer science and have a lot of experience programming outside of university.
            I have a lot of experience programming in Python and especially C++.
            I was inspired to learn these languages by the desire to develop simulations of complex social and physical systems.
            I also really love working at a very low level with computers.
            I love digital logic and retro computer processors like the 6502!
